Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

what is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object and a desired output value. 
A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.

Goal:
We are given a training dataset of n points of the form (x1, y1), (x2,y2), .. (xn,yn).
Where the yi's are either 1 or -1, each indicating the class to which the point xi's belong. 
Each xi's is a p-dimensional real vector. We want to find the "maximum-margin hyperplane" that divides the group of points xi's for which yi=1 from the group of points for which yi=-1, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point xi from either group is maximized.
