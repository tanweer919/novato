# Notes towards a future Waterbear presentation

Ladies, gentlemen, scratch that, friends of all genders, preferences and presentations. Cousins of every color, creed and nation. I would like to talk to you about a tool that will make your lives easier and better in many ways.

Imagine being able to program your computer, without having to study computer science! Imagine being unable to make syntax errors in your code! Imagine being able to discover the available libraries and tools by looking at them directly, rather than poring over obscure, cobweb-covered documentation!

I present to you: Waterbear!

As you all know, waterbears are the most resilient creatures on our planet. They are able to survive at incredible deep sea pressure, in the cold vacuum of outer space, in the scalding heat of volcanic vents, and in trackless icy wastes. They can survive years without food or water, can withstand massive doses of radiation, but are most comfortable in a dewdrop in the moss behind your house.

Programming languages are often named after the properties their creators wish them to have. After years of languages like 'A', 'B', 'C', 'C++', etc., we have languages now like 'Java', named because you'll need a lot of coffee before you attempt it, and 'Python' named (I am not making this up) after the Monty Python comedy troupe. We have 'Ruby' which is intended to be shinier than 'Perl'. And so on. Waterbear is named after the most robust, yet friendly, creature on earth because it is intended as a tool for beginners, but to allow them to grow and build powerful programs under their own control.

Unlike those other languages, Waterbear is not itself a programming language, but a tool for creating visual wrappers for existing programming languages. The primary wrapper is for JavaScript, but there are wrappers for other languages, with more under development all the time. Waterbear itself is also written in JavaScript (and HTML and CSS), so it will run anywhere you can run a webbrowser: on you desktop or laptop, on your tablet, even on your phone. Yes, you too will achieve the long-held dream of writing code on your phone during a long subway ride, thanks to the power of the Waterbear!

Friends, there are many tools to help people learn to code. Waterbear is not the only microscopic organism in that sea. Some of them charge money, some are written in flash (which won't run on your phone or tablet, sad to say), and some are trying to train computer scientists. I have nothing against computer scientists, some of my best friends are computer scientists, and in fact, I happen to be a computer scientist myself, but I recognize that not everyone wants that distinction.

However, we live in a world run by computers. They are everywhere and are taking over more and more aspects of our lives. One solution to this is to turn off the damned computer and go outside, talk with friends, play board games with your children. But you'll be back on the computer, and let me tell you, if you don't control your computer, then it is controlling you.

Being able to write code is basic, fundamental literacy in this day and age, and it is hard won if you have to learn how to write loops correctly and understand how recursion works before you can tell your phone to turn down the volume at 10pm every day. We can do better. We *have* to do better.

If you are not a native English speaker, you can code Waterbear in your native language. The blocks are translated, so you can share code between speakers of different languages. Try that with Java!

Now, you may have heard that visual programming is dead. It was tried, and it failed. It has been tried, many times, and many of those attempts have been failures. However, the Scratch language that was the direct inspiration for Waterbear has millions of users and its own fantastic and popular social network for sharing code and learning together. It turns our there are several niches where visual programming has survived and is doing quite well. So rumours of its death are greatly exaggerated, but we do want to learn from the mistakes of our predessesors.

Do we even need Waterbear if Scratch is doing so well? Scratch is intended for children, and is very focussed on animation and games. This is great and has resulted in a powerful system that is easy to learn. But because of the nature of its audience, Scratch is limited. It holds you back from the full power of the internet, because the internet isn't a safe place for young children. That's OK and a reasonable tradeoff to make. But what if you want the power and the readability of Scratch's blocks without the training wheels? That's where Waterbear comes in.

With Waterbear you can unleash the full power of the internet. You can do things that are dangerous (although we do try to warn you when you're about to). You can script Node servers, control robots using Java, write code for Arduino and RaspberryPi, create new apps on your phone, and also make games and animations like Scratch.

Waterbear blocks are easy to work with, and it is easy to create new blocks or languages to test out some crazy idea. You can create two sets of blocks to A/B test with, or only show subsets of a bigger language in stages for pedagogical purposes as you introduce each new concept. We've only begun to scratch the surface of the possibilities.

My friends, that is where you come in. We need genuine folk such as yourselves to try it out, to use it in lessons, to see what works and what doesn't. Waterbear is still a young system and this is your chance to get on board this wagon as we head into the great unknown to see where it takes us. Won't you come on board?
