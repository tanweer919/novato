Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

what is Supervised Learning?

In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object and a desired output value. 
A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.

Goal:

polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. 

<img src = "../images/models/polynomialSVM.png">

Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x), where E is some function.

This is used to describe nonlinear phenomena such as the growth rate of tissues.
