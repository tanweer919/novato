In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. 
In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.

what is classification?
Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations whose category membership is known. 
An example would be assigning a given email into "spam" or "non-spam".

what is Regression?
Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables
Regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

Goal:
This regression is based on k-nearest neighbors.
The target is predicted by local interpolation of the targets associated of the nearest neighbors in the training set.
