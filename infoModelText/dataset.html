A data set is a collection of data.<br><br>
Most commonly a data set corresponds to the contents of a single database table, or a single statistical data matrix, where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question.<br><br>
The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.<br><br>
Each value is known as a datum.
