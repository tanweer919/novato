In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data.<br>
Such models are called linear models.<br>

Goal:<br>
This example uses the only the first feature of the diabetes dataset, in order to illustrate a two-dimensional plot of this regression technique. <br>

The straight line can be seen in the plot. <br>
This show how linear regression attempts to draw a straight line that will best minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed responses in the dataset, and the responses predicted by the linear approximation.<br>
